In writing this post I won't focus on why performance is important. I'm really going out on a limb here because many engineers do not know why performance might matter and the impact you might receive by improving your apps performanceâ€”a really surprising fact. Instead of going in depth here with why performance is important, I'll give you some great resources and summarize some key takeaways from each.

There are countless case studies which have shown that improving time to interactive and the speed of your site is one of the best ways to increase and retain the number of users interacting with your site.
https://wpostats.com contains a repository of case studies which show the importance of web performance optimizations and is a great resource for a number of studies on the subject.

Google developer web fundamentals has a great section on [why web performance matters](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters) cites numerous case studies that show how important performance is to both retaining users and improving conversions. 

If reading case studies and Google developer guides is not convincing enough for you (you need to hear revenue projections), Google also provides a [great tool to measure your application's performance](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/testmysite/) and then compare this to your competitiors. This is a great tool especially for e-commerce sites, because it uses the average order amount per visit to attain estimated revenue increases for each 100ms improvement in page load times. After you've measured your apps performance and compared it to a competitior it presents the impact a faster site can have on your business in terms of annual revenue.


### Top web application performance bottlenecks
---
1. Amount of Javascript on the initial page load
2. Amount of CSS on the initial page load
3. Amount of network requests on the initial page load
4. Inefficient database queries
5. Overly-complex server-side payload data sizes, manipulations, look-ups and service calls

### Performance budget
---
A performance budget is necessary and will become increasingly necessary as companies increasingly expand across the world and into developing markets. 

5G has just begun in the US at the time of writing, but in places like India [4G speeds are still as slow as 6Mbps (as of 2018)](https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2018/02/state-of-lte). In fact, the United states has one of the slowest 4G speeds across the world falling into the bottom 31% of countries in the open signal report with an average 4g speed of 16.3Mbps.

#### So, what's a realistic performance budget? 
A performance budget can be many different things. It really is kind of vague. It could be a goal for page load times (like 3 seconds on 3g connections with mid-market mobile devices). It could also be a goal in terms of code size (like 300kb uncompressed Javascript). The specific performance budget that fits for you and your team can vary depending on the state of your teams application. Hopefully that information in this post can help you come up with a worthwhile budget for your app.

## Reducing the amount of Javascript on initial load...how?
#### If you're not on Webpack v4 in your application, update it.
#### Code Splitting
<b>Splitting out page critical code into async chunks (at build time)</b> and importing them asynchronously and on demand as the user navigates around your site.
Webpack gives us a much easier interface for Code splitting with version 4 by returning a promise with any call to `import('./<filePath>')`, though it can be done using version 3 with [require.resolve](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#requireresolve).
```js
// pages/home.js
import NextPageNavigationButton from '../buttons/nextPage';

const getComponent = () => import('./src/asyncComponent.js');

NextPageNavigationButton.on('click', () => {
  // dynamically load the component via network request when warranted
  getComponent().then((module) => {
    const target = document.getElementById('placeWhereComponentShouldGo');
    module.initComponent(target);
  })
})
```

#### [Tree Shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/)
<b>Removal of dead code (within module scope) by detecting via [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) statements whether code modules are exported and imported for use between modules.</b> If a module is unused, it is removed from the bundle.


In this below example, the function fly is removed from the bundle produced by Webpack or Rollup:
```js
// modules.js
export function drive(props) {
  return props.drive
}
export function fly(props) {
  return props.mile
}
// modules.js
--------------------------------------------

// main.js
import { drive } from modules;

// some code
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        drive({ car: event.target })
      </ul>
    <dive>
  )
}
// main.js
```
<br>
<br>

#### Browser Code Coverage
A measurment of the amount of code that is used by the browser is called Code Coverage. Since 2017, Code Coverage as been supported in Chrome Developer Tools and offers an excellent resource to reduce the amount of dead code in your application. Using the coverage drawer, you can identify line-by-line what code is being used at each page.

#### Webpack Bundle Analyzer

<b>Disclaimer:</b> [Using Giffs is not ideal](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/replace-animated-gifs-with-video). They are huge! Stick to jpg or png files.

This plugin can help you to visualize the effect you are having with your Code Splitting and Tree Shaking (Tree Shaking is only enabled for Webpack in production mode).

### Network request sizes
---
Say, for example, you load address metadata containing all address labels, validations, formats, and translations for all worldwide addresses in your application on the initial load via server-side request to a different API. This could amount to a significant amount of Javascript loaded on your site. Do you really need all address metadata for all countries on the initial load? 

Users will most likely be dealing with one country, and if it's needed to input an address in a different country, most likely there is a need to change the input country somehow, like using a dropdown or something like that. 

To cut down the amount of Javascript sent down to the client in this example, we could dynamically load the address metadata, for only the individual country that is needed when the user selects a different country from a dropdown that is used on your site. 

We could create a new route to send down the metadata for the particular country and send off AJAX requests client-side when the user selects a different country.

### Parallel requests
---
Take advantage of browser parallel request capabilities. 
A blocking request is a browser AJAX request that blocks other network requests from occuring when the browser may support up to 8 simultaneous. If you peform more than one  network request from your app during the initial load, make them parallel and non-blocking. 

### Maintaining improvements
---
Block builds!
```js
// webpack.config.js
performance: {
  assetFilter: (assetFilename) => (/\.(png|jpg|gif|svg)$/).test(assetFilename),
  maxAssetSize: 20000,
  hints: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'error' : 'warning',
  maxEntrypointSize: 65000
}
```
